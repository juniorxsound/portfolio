about: "‘Trumpet’ is a Node.js server that listens to tweets from NYC that contain the words “trump” and “protest” and plays a note for every tweet. I developed ‘Trumpet’ with Dror Ayalon during Spotify’s NYC Monthly Music Hackathon.

Since the Hackathon took place on January 21st, 2017, a day after Donald Trump’s inauguration, we knew we wanted to create a generative music composition based on people emotions towards the president elect, and the protests around the inauguration."
