about: "Volume is a tool for reconstructing a single 2D image or video in 3D space. Using state-of-the-art machine learning research, Volume is able to generate a 3D asset from a single view. Volume is currently under development and is being built as an end-to-end solution allowing anyone to easily generate a 3D asset and use it in 3D environments. Volume is intended to encourage easy prototyping in virtual, augmented and mixed reality platforms. Volume was used to create the Inside Pulp Fiction project, and ReTouch."
