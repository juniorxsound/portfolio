about: "‘Visualizer’ was born after an R&D process I did with Roey Tsemah and Ronen Tanchum. Initially our goal was to research how we could use the Web Audio API, to analyse incoming signal (music or microphone inputs), and drive geometry deformations in real-time, while keeping performance optimal so it could run on mobile browsers as well.

After the R&D process was done, I went on to design the concept art for this visualizer, using 3D animation and environment design software packages and then implementing these designs in the web using Three.js. This work was made possible thanks to the amazing post “Experiments with Perlin Noise” examples by Jaume Sanchez."
