about: "ReTouch is an OpenGL application that enables editing and retouching of images using depth-maps in 2.5D. The depth maps are generated by Volume, a state of the art tool, that uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to predict depth-maps from 2D images . ReTouch uses these depth-maps to enable the addition of depth of field and color retouching for the foreground and background separately."
