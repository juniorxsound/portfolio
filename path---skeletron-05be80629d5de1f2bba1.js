The system sends the data about the position of the human body to Unity, a 3D game development engine, to allow engineers, artists, and creative technologists to use it to develop digital experiences.\nSkeletron was developed thanks and as a part of NYU ITP Xstory grant (Experiments in Storytelling).",cover:"",credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="https://drorayalon.com">Dror Ayalon</a>. <br />Attribution: VNect ML Model VNect TensorFlow Port',title:"Skeletron",press:[["The Next Web","https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/01/30/programmers-use-tensorflow-ai-to-turn-any-webcam-into-microsoft-kinect/"],["Tech Radar","https://www.techradar.com/news/ai-developers-can-turn-any-webcam-into-a-kinect"],["GeekTime","https://www.geektime.co.il/developers-create-kinect-with-tensorflow-and-webcam/"],["Android Headlines","https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/01/tensorflow-unity-turn-webcams-into-ai-powered-ar-systems.html"],["FossBytes","https://fossbytes.com/programmers-transform-a-10-webcam-into-microsoft-kinect/"]],links:[["Presskit","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18uzf-grMetd9bZPNMHDNs7IZWZHNFmKY"]],embed:'<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_owi316cE8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>',tags:["Machine Learning","Tools"],excerpt:"Predict joints and human skeleton position from real-time video."}}},pathContext:{}}}});
