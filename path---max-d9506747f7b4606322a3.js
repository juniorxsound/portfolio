The square became a home for the lonely and marginalized characters of the area. This project tells the story of the people who gravitated toward the square and spent their days in it. In this interactive webVR documentary, they talk about their lives and the square. Together, they form a poetic musing on lost loves and things that have passed. Tzina invites you to physically explore the virtual square, combining elements of fantasy, while experiencing the square in different times of the day.\nI served as the project’s technical director, in which I got to shoot, develop, write music and implement features in the experience.",embed:'<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/187784291?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>',excerpt:"A virtual reality documentary about love and lonliness.",tags:["Virtual Reality"]}}}}}});
