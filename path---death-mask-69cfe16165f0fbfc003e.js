The project uses a machine learning model titled AgeNet for the prediction process. Once predicted it uses the average life expectancy in that location to try and estimate how long one has left.\nThe aesthetic inspiration derives from the concept of death masks. These are sculptures meant to symbolize the death of a person by casting his face (i.e creating a mask).",cover:"deathmask_cover.png",credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="http://agermanidis.com">Anastasis Germanidis</a>',title:"Death Mask",press:[["Wired","https://www.wired.it/attualita/tech/2017/12/20/death-mask-realta-morte-previsione/"],["UploadVR","https://uploadvr.com/arkit-death-mask/"],["Next Reailty","https://next.reality.news/news/ar-experiment-adds-life-clock-anyone-with-face-0181330/"],["VRInside","https://vrinside.jp/news/death-mask/"],["Shiropen","https://shiropen.com/2017/11/29/29963"],["Owdin","https://owdin.live/2017/11/24/death-mask-combien-dannees-de-vie-vous-reste-t-il-version-realite-augmentee/"],["prosthetic knowledge","http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/167809095736/death-mask-programming-project-from-or-fleisher"],["Realite Virtuelle","https://www.realite-virtuelle.com/death-mask-age-mort-2911"]],links:[["Documentation","http://itp.orfleisher.com/2017/11/17/where-is-the-line-with-public-data/"]],embed:'<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzndnZuvu2c?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>',tags:["Augmented Reality","Machine Learning","Experiment"],excerpt:"Predict how long people have to live in augmented reality."}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/retouch.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-23T22:12:03.284Z",path:"/retouch",title:"ReTouch",links:[["Github","https://github.com/juniorxsound/ReTouch"]],credits:"Developed by under the advisement of Prof. Ken Perlin and Prof. Daniele Panozzo @ Computer Science Department, New York University",press:[],components:[["code","C++, GLSL"],["software","Volume"],["3d","OpenGL"]],cover:"shining.jpg",about:"ReTouch is an OpenGL application that enables editing and retouching of images using depth-maps in 2.5D.
