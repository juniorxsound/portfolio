The music, like the visuals – is binaural, allowing the audience to move around and hear what they would hear if they were surrounded by the band.\nThe experience can be watched on a wide range of platforms from desktop computers, mobile phones and VR headsets.",embed:'<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e30AUS9HFtE?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>',excerpt:"A cosmic webVR music performance",tags:["Virtual Reality"]}},next:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/skeletron.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-06-17T12:23:00+00:02",path:"/skeletron",title:"Skeletron",links:[["Presskit","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18uzf-grMetd9bZPNMHDNs7IZWZHNFmKY"]],credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="https://drorayalon.com">Dror Ayalon</a>. <br />Attribution: VNect ML Model VNect TensorFlow Port',press:[["The Next Web","https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/01/30/programmers-use-tensorflow-ai-to-turn-any-webcam-into-microsoft-kinect/"],["Tech Radar","https://www.techradar.com/news/ai-developers-can-turn-any-webcam-into-a-kinect"],["GeekTime","https://www.geektime.co.il/developers-create-kinect-with-tensorflow-and-webcam/"],["Android Headlines","https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/01/tensorflow-unity-turn-webcams-into-ai-powered-ar-systems.html"],["FossBytes","https://fossbytes.com/programmers-transform-a-10-webcam-into-microsoft-kinect/"]],components:[["code","C#, HLSL Python"],["software","Unity3D"],["3d","Tensorflow"]],cover:"skeletron.jpg",about:"Skeletron is a system that predicts joints and human skeleton position from real-time video taken by any RGB camera, such as a webcam.
