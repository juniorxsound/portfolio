Using state-of-the-art machine learning research, Volume is able to generate a 3D asset from a single view. Volume is currently under development and is being built as an end-to-end solution allowing anyone to easily generate a 3D asset and use it in 3D environments. Volume is intended to encourage easy prototyping in virtual, augmented and mixed reality platforms. Volume was used to create the Inside Pulp Fiction project, and ReTouch.",cover:"volume_cover.jpg",credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="https://shirin.works">~shirin anlen</a>',title:"Volume",press:[["The Next Web","https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/03/08/try-this-ai-experiment-that-converts-2d-images-to-3d/"],["Discovery Channel","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi4yof2yy04"],["prosthetic knowledge","http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/171637247736/volume-online-update-update-to-machine-learning"],["Tecmundo","https://www.tecmundo.com.br/software/127998-ia-transforma-qualquer-foto-modelo-3d-teste.htm"]],links:[["Website","https://volume.gl"],["Github","https://github.com/Volume-GL"],["Presskit","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XBQgptNAchJr0kUSD0LhzUzxdKnZ4Rud"],["Presentation","https://vimeo.com/270479574"]],embed:"",tags:["Augmented Reality","Machine Learning","Virtual Reality","Tools"],excerpt:"Reconstruct 2D images and video in 3D using machine learning."}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/dms.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-23T12:16:00+00:02",path:"/dms",title:"DMS",links:[["Documentation","http://itp.orfleisher.com/2016/12/14/dms-physical-computing-csound-final/"]],credits:"",press:[],components:[["code","Arduino, cSound"],["software","Node.js, cSound Node Bindings"],["3d","Ultimaker 2+, Epilog Laser Cutter"]],cover:"dms.png",about:"‘DMS’ which stands for Different Modular Synth, is a concept design for a synth system.
