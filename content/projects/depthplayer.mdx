### About

During the NYC Volumetric Filmmaker's meetup (which I help co-organize), we presetned

**Volumetric Video Player**: a WebGL volumetric video player I developed in Javascript, that is able to playback volumetric video hosted on Vimeo.

**RealSense Depth Viewer**: a RealSense depth viewer I developed in C++ using OpenGL, that is able to capture depth data from a RealSense cameras and clean it up.

**Live Streaming Volumetric Video**: We also presented an approach to live-streaming volumetric video using Vimeo Live.
