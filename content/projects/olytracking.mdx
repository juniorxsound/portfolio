### About

In preparation for the Summer Olympic Games, we built and deployed a cloud pipeline that is able to pre-process annotations and generate speed plots throughout a race.

**Cloud Pipeline**: We built and deployed a cloud pipeline that is able to pre-process annotations and generate speed plots throughout a race.

**Annotations**: We used annotations to generate speed plots throughout a race.

**Speed Plots**: We used speed plots to generate speed plots throughout a race.
