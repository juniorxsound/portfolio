### About

See just how effective wearing a mask can be at fighting the pandemic.

**Mask Filteration**: We used mask filteration research to understand and visualize how effective wearing a mask can be at fighting the spread of particles.

**Interactive Visualization**: We used an interactive 3D visualization to help explain how mask filteration works by taking readers inside the fibers of a mask.
