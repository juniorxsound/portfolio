### About

We visualized a cough to show how far respiratory droplets can spread. If you haven’t been keeping your distance to fight the coronavirus, this may persuade you.\nWe also used augmented reality to show you how social distancing guidelines can apply in real life: at the grocery store, on the sidewalk, or anywhere else.

The project consisted of three technical innovations:

**Parsing and visualizing simulation data**: Using a particle simulation of how respiratory droplets spread, we parsed VTK datasets, filtered and converted them into a format that can be played back in real time.

**Augmented Reality**: We used augmented reality to show you how social distancing guidelines can apply in real life: at the grocery store, on the sidewalk, or anywhere else.

**Interactive Visualization**: We used WebGL to create an interactive visualization of the simulation data.
