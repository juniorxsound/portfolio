about: "We visualized a cough to show how far respiratory droplets can spread. If you havenâ€™t been keeping your distance to fight the coronavirus, this may persuade you.

We also used augmented reality to show you how social distancing guidelines can apply in real life: at the grocery store, on the sidewalk, or anywhere else. See the video of this here. To experience this in your space, you will need to use the NYTimes iOS App on a newer iPhone or iPad."
