about: "As part of The Times's coverage of Super Bowl LVII, R&D and The New York Times Graphics Desk collaborated to offer readers a 3D perspective on a decisive moment of the game â€” when Kansas City receiver Kadarius Toney slipped past Philadelphia Eagles receiver Zach Pascal during a late game punt return. An artificial intelligence machine learning model was used to generate 3D models of athletes from a single photograph for the key moment."
