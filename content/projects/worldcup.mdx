about: "For The Times’s analysis of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, R&D and The New York Times graphics desk collaborated on a series of interactive articles that enable a viewer to see key plays in 3D. To accomplish this, R&D developed a workflow to swiftly create 3D models of athletes in action from a single photograph.

This new method, assisted by a computer vision machine learning model, allowed us to model a 3D scene in just a few hours and publish an immersive story on a news deadline."
