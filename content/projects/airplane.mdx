### About

To understand how risky it may be to board a flight now, start with how air circulates in a plane.

**Air Circulation**: We used air circulation modelling to understand how risky it may be to board a flight now.

**Maya Addon**: We created a custom Maya addon that's able to parse VTK particle simulation datasets and convert them into Maya particles for visualization.

**Interactive Visualization**: We used an interactive visualization to understand how risky it may be to board a flight now.
