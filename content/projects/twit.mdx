### About

TwitAR is a speculative satirical experiment that examines how Twitter tweets could be visualized in Augmented Reality.

TwitAR tries to playfully imagine what would happen if Twitter intruded our everyday reality. The experiment uses Apple’s ARKit to visualize tweets in Augmented Reality on the world itself.

To match the context to what the user is seeing it uses Machine Learning (Apple’s CoreML) to classify the objects you are looking at and pulls tweets from Twitter based on this classification.
