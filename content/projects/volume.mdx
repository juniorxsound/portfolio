### About

Volume is a tool for reconstructing a single 2D image or video in 3D space.

Using state-of-the-art machine learning research, Volume is able to generate a 3D asset from a single view.

Volume was my graduate school thesis in ITP at NYU, which I developed with Shirin Anlen.

**Machine Learning**: Based on state-of-the-art machine learning research, Volume is included a fine tuned monocular depth estimation model that is used to reconstruct a single 2D image or video in 3D space.

**API/volume.gl**: Volume was built as an end-to-end solution allowing anyone to easily generate a 3D asset and use it in 3D environments using either our inference API or make.volume web app.

### Experiments

In the process of developing Volume, I built a number of experiments to explore the capabilities of using depth estimation to reconstruct archival footage.

**Inside Pulp Fiction**

Inside Pulp Fiction is an experiment that uses Volume to reconstruct Pulp Fiction's iconic dance scene in Augmented Reality.

**ReTouch**

ReTouch is an OpenGL application that enables editing and retouching of images using depth-maps in 2.5D.
