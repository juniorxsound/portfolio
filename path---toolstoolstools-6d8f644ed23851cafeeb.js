The music, like the visuals – is binaural, allowing the audience to move around and hear what they would hear if they were surrounded by the band.\nThe experience can be watched on a wide range of platforms from desktop computers, mobile phones and VR headsets.",embed:'<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e30AUS9HFtE?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>',excerpt:"A cosmic webVR music performance",tags:["Virtual Reality"]}},next:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/detune.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-05-23T12:25:00+00:00",path:"/detune",title:"detune",links:[["Website","https://detune.app"],["App store","https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/detune-music-with-your-face/id1370740132?mt=8"],["Github","https://github.com/dodiku/detune"],["Presskit","http://www.detuneapp.com/media.html"]],credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="https://drorayalon.com">Dror Ayalon</a>',press:[["AudioKit","https://audiokitpro.com/detune-play-music-with-your-face/"]],components:[["code","Swift"],["software","AudioKit"],["3d","iPhoneX TrueDepth"]],cover:"detune_cover.png",about:"detune uses Apple’s ARKit and the TrueDepth camera (currently available only on iPhone X) to trigger music events, and to allow users to play music using face impressions.
