The music, like the visuals – is binaural, allowing the audience to move around and hear what they would hear if they were surrounded by the band.\nThe experience can be watched on a wide range of platforms from desktop computers, mobile phones and VR headsets.",cover:"",credits:"Developed with Yannis Gravezas, Ronen Tanchum, Ilya Marcus and Livyatanim",title:"Sono",press:[["Creators Project","https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/aenxpb/sono-livyatanim-audio-reactive-live-vr-performance"],["WebVR Experiments with Google","https://experiments.withgoogle.com/sono"],["VRRoom","https://www.vrroom.buzz/vr-news/immersive-arts/cosmic-visuals-react-live-audio-vr-show"]],links:[["Full Experience","http://sono.livyatanim.com/"],["Album","https://livyatanim.bandcamp.com"],["Presskit","http://sono.livyatanim.com/media/sono_mediakit.zip"],["Making-of","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0eb7B9yoo"]],embed:'<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e30AUS9HFtE?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>',tags:["Virtual Reality"],excerpt:"A cosmic webVR music performance"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
