Using state-of-the-art machine learning research, Volume is able to generate a 3D asset from a single view. Volume is currently under development and is being built as an end-to-end solution allowing anyone to easily generate a 3D asset and use it in 3D environments. Volume is intended to encourage easy prototyping in virtual, augmented and mixed reality platforms.
