Initially our goal was to research how we could use the Web Audio API, to analyse incoming signal (music or microphone inputs), and drive geometry deformations in real-time, while keeping performance optimal so it could run on mobile browsers as well.\nAfter the R&D process was done, I went on to design the concept art for this visualizer, using 3D animation and environment design software packages and then implementing these designs in the web using Three.js. This work was made possible thanks to the amazing post “Experiments with Perlin Noise” examples by Jaume Sanchez.",cover:"visualizer.png",credits:"",title:"Visualizer",press:[],links:[["Demo","https://juniorxsound.github.io/ICM-Fall-2016/3D_Web_Audio_Visualiser/"],["Github","https://github.com/juniorxsound/ICM-Fall-2016/tree/master/3D_Web_Audio_Visualiser"]],embed:"",tags:["Experiment"],excerpt:"A 3D web audio sound visulaizer."}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/tzina.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-23T12:34:00+00:02",path:"/tzina",title:"Tzina",links:[["Full Experience","http://tzina.space"],["Making-of","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0IIKgNnctY"],["Github","https://github.com/Avnerus/tzina"]],credits:'Directed with <a target="_blank" href="https://shirin.works">~shirin anlen</a>.

The square became a home for the lonely and marginalized characters of the area. This project tells the story of the people who gravitated toward the square and spent their days in it. In this interactive webVR documentary, they talk about their lives and the square. Together, they form a poetic musing on lost loves and things that have passed. Tzina invites you to physically explore the virtual square, combining elements of fantasy, while experiencing the square in different times of the day.\nI served as the project’s technical director, in which I got to shoot, develop, write music and implement features in the experience.",embed:'<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/187784291?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>',excerpt:"A virtual reality documentary about love and lonliness.",tags:["Virtual Reality"]}},next:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/volume.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-23T12:34:00+00:02",path:"/volume",title:"Volume",links:[["Website","https://volume.gl"],["Github","https://github.com/Volume-GL"],["Presskit","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XBQgptNAchJr0kUSD0LhzUzxdKnZ4Rud"],["Presentation","https://vimeo.com/270479574"]],credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="https://shirin.works">~shirin anlen</a>',press:[["The Next Web","https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/03/08/try-this-ai-experiment-that-converts-2d-images-to-3d/"],["Discovery Channel","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi4yof2yy04"],["prosthetic knowledge","http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/171637247736/volume-online-update-update-to-machine-learning"],["Tecmundo","https://www.tecmundo.com.br/software/127998-ia-transforma-qualquer-foto-modelo-3d-teste.htm"]],components:[["code","Python, Javascript, GLSL, C#, HLSL"],["software","Three.js, Unity3D, Unreal Engine, Blender"],["3d","Tensorflow, Heroku, Firebase"]],cover:"volume_cover.jpg",about:"Volume is a tool for reconstructing a single 2D image or video in 3D space.
