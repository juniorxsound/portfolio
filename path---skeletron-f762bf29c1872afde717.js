The system sends the data about the position of the human body to Unity, a 3D game development engine, to allow engineers, artists, and creative technologists to use it to develop digital experiences.\nSkeletron was developed thanks and as a part of NYU ITP Xstory grant (Experiments in Storytelling).",cover:"skeletron.jpg",credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="https://drorayalon.com">Dror Ayalon</a>. <br />Attribution: VNect ML Model VNect TensorFlow Port',title:"Skeletron",press:[["The Next Web","https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/01/30/programmers-use-tensorflow-ai-to-turn-any-webcam-into-microsoft-kinect/"],["Tech Radar","https://www.techradar.com/news/ai-developers-can-turn-any-webcam-into-a-kinect"],["GeekTime","https://www.geektime.co.il/developers-create-kinect-with-tensorflow-and-webcam/"],["Android Headlines","https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/01/tensorflow-unity-turn-webcams-into-ai-powered-ar-systems.html"],["FossBytes","https://fossbytes.com/programmers-transform-a-10-webcam-into-microsoft-kinect/"]],links:[["Presskit","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18uzf-grMetd9bZPNMHDNs7IZWZHNFmKY"]],embed:'<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_owi316cE8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>',tags:["Machine Learning","Tools"],excerpt:"Predict joints and human skeleton position from real-time video."}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/aframe.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-16T22:12:03.284Z",path:"/aframe",title:"DepthKit for AFrame",links:[["Github","https://github.com/juniorxsound/DepthKit-A-Frame"],["npm package","https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-depthkit"]],credits:"",press:[],components:[["code","Javascript, GLSL"],["software","DepthKit"],["3d","AFrame"]],cover:"aframe_cover.jpg",about:"An A-Frame component for rendering Volumetric videos captured using DepthKit (i.e Kinect + DSLR) in WebVR.

Initially our goal was to research how we could use the Web Audio API, to analyse incoming signal (music or microphone inputs), and drive geometry deformations in real-time, while keeping performance optimal so it could run on mobile browsers as well.\nAfter the R&D process was done, I went on to design the concept art for this visualizer, using 3D animation and environment design software packages and then implementing these designs in the web using Three.js. This work was made possible thanks to the amazing post “Experiments with Perlin Noise” examples by Jaume Sanchez.",embed:"",excerpt:"A 3D web audio sound visulaizer.",tags:["Experiment"]}}}}}});
