Initially our goal was to research how we could use the Web Audio API, to analyse incoming signal (music or microphone inputs), and drive geometry deformations in real-time, while keeping performance optimal so it could run on mobile browsers as well.\nAfter the R&D process was done, I went on to design the concept art for this visualizer, using 3D animation and environment design software packages and then implementing these designs in the web using Three.js. This work was made possible thanks to the amazing post “Experiments with Perlin Noise” examples by Jaume Sanchez.",cover:"visualizer.png",credits:"",title:"Visualizer",press:[],links:[["Demo","https://juniorxsound.github.io/ICM-Fall-2016/3D_Web_Audio_Visualiser/"],["Github","https://github.com/juniorxsound/ICM-Fall-2016/tree/master/3D_Web_Audio_Visualiser"]],embed:"",tags:["Experiment"],excerpt:"A 3D web audio sound visulaizer."}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/retouch.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-23T12:21:00+00:02",path:"/retouch",title:"ReTouch",links:[["Github","https://github.com/juniorxsound/ReTouch"]],credits:"Developed by under the advisement of Prof. Ken Perlin and Prof. Daniele Panozzo @ Computer Science Department, New York University",press:[],components:[["code","C++, GLSL"],["software","Volume"],["3d","OpenGL"]],cover:"shining.jpg",about:"ReTouch is an OpenGL application that enables editing and retouching of images using depth-maps in 2.5D.

ReTouch uses these depth-maps to enable the addition of depth of field and color retouching for the foreground and background separately.",embed:'<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CAsy_jm85ZY?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>',excerpt:"Edit and retouch any image in 2.5D.",tags:["Machine Learning","Tools"]}},next:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/trumpet.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-23T12:18:00+00:02",path:"/trumpet",title:"Trumpet",links:[["Github","https://github.com/dodiku/trumpet"]],credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="http://drorayalon.com">Dror Ayalon</a>',press:[],components:[["code","Javascript, cSound"],["software","Node.js, cSound Node Bindings"],["3d","Twitter API"]],cover:"trumpet.png",about:"‘Trumpet’ is a Node.js server that listens to tweets from NYC that contain the words “trump” and “protest” and plays a note for every tweet.
