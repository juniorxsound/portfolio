The film takes place in a dark surreal world, which aims to blur the lines between digital and natural imagery.\nThe film uses the composition’s notation, rhythms and melodies (MIDI), to control elements ranging from drums affecting the geometry to transitions between scenes. In effect, using this data transformed from being a musical composition language, to a visual directing language.\nThe experience can be watched on a wide range of platforms from desktop computers, mobile phones and VR headsets.",cover:"myth-cover.png",credits:"Developed with Yannis Gravezas, Tomer Rousso and Livyatanim",title:"Myth",press:[["Wired","https://www.wired.de/collection/life/10-virtual-reality-filme-die-man-gesehen-haben-muss"],["Creators Project","https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/ez5qva/float-through-a-virtual-world-of-hybrid-beings-in-myth"],["We and the Color","https://weandthecolor.com/webgl-short-film-livyatanim-myth/62302"],["prosthetic knowledge","http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/133824524661/myth-interactive-web-music-video-for-livyatanim'"],["Z","http://z.ultranoir.com/en/articles/1282-livyatanim-myth-a-vr-film-by-or-fleisher.html"],["Chrome Experiments","https://experiments.withgoogle.com/livyatanim-myth"],["WorldFest- NASA Remi Award winner","#"],["UrbamMediaMakers Best Interactive Award Winner","#"],["The FWA – WOTD","#"],["CSS Awards – WOTD","#"],["Awwwards – Honorable Mention","#"]],links:[["Full Experience","http://film.livyatanim.com"],["Album","https://livyatanim.bandcamp.com"],["Presskit","http://film.livyatanim.com/media/mediakit.zip"]],embed:'<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/145578640?autoplay=0&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>',tags:["Virtual Reality"],excerpt:"An audio reactive virtual reality short film."}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:"",id:"/home/travis/build/juniorxsound/portfolio/src/pages/projects/volume.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-06-25T12:34:00+00:02",path:"/volume",title:"Volume",links:[["Website","https://volume.gl"],["Github","https://github.com/Volume-GL"],["Presskit","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XBQgptNAchJr0kUSD0LhzUzxdKnZ4Rud"],["Presentation","https://vimeo.com/270479574"]],credits:'Developed with <a target="_blank" href="https://shirin.works">~shirin anlen</a>',press:[["The Next Web","https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/03/08/try-this-ai-experiment-that-converts-2d-images-to-3d/"],["Discovery Channel","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi4yof2yy04"],["prosthetic knowledge","http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/171637247736/volume-online-update-update-to-machine-learning"],["Tecmundo","https://www.tecmundo.com.br/software/127998-ia-transforma-qualquer-foto-modelo-3d-teste.htm"]],components:[["code","Python, Javascript, GLSL, C#, HLSL"],["software","Three.js, Unity3D, Unreal Engine, Blender"],["3d","Tensorflow, Heroku, Firebase"]],cover:"volume_cover.jpg",about:"Volume is a tool for reconstructing a single 2D image or video in 3D space.
